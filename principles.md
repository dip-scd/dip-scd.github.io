### Continuous information flow instead of periodical meetings
Any periodical meeting (sync-up, standup, demo, grooming etc.) is a workaround that mitigates lack of proper communication channels in the organisation. It can and should be replaced by continuous flow of information, automatic documentation and ad-hoc (on demand) meetings with concrete agenda.

### Documentation as a primary source of knowledge
Knowledge must be shared via documentation. Emails, IM, comments, meetings are for active discussions at the stage when decision or expertise regarding specific topic is still emerging (i.e. for expert-to-expert communication). Once knowledge is acquired, it must be communicated to consumers via persistent documentation. Documentation still can be commented, discussed and changed, but main point is that it can be easily referenced and shared.

### Continuous processes automation
Processes automation is an essential activity that must have dedicated resources, not just some optional sporadic activity.

### Either small or moderated meetings 
Non-moderated meeting with 5+ people is likely to be non-productive. With 10+ people it’s almost inevitable. These numbers are just empirical observations, there is no formal theory behind them.

### Only actually working processes
If process is unrealistic and clunky, it must be reviewed and changed asap, instead of ignoring the fact that everyone is working around this process. If process in its current form is really necessary (for example, it’s related to security), then enforcing mechanisms should be introduced. One way or another, there must not be the case that process exists but people are not working by it.

### Removing instead of adding
Often much more can be achieved by removing a process, role, implementation, specification, then by adding a new one. Therefore there should be a continuous (rather than stop-the-world) process of refactoring of the technical systems and organisation itself. People tend to avoid removing things because they don’t feel they have an authority to do so. Also, removing something requires a detailed analysis of the context while adding something just seems easier and safer. This has devastating effect on organisation, team or technical system complexity and effectivity.

### Avoiding redundant information
Information must be referenced, not copy-pasted. In case of documentation this means that it should be created as hypertext, not text. In case of communication this means that proxy-mailing and similar practicies must be avoided.

### Reusing external knowledge
Establishing internal mentorship and knowledge sharing is a good thing, but it’s important not to forget that there is whole world out there. There is no need to re-invent internal best coding practices or project management essentials course. There is enough high-quality public information on that topic.

### Roles, not titles
Titles are often don’t represent the reality since they are opaque and also obsolete due to a lagging formal promotion cycle. List of current roles per person is a better alternative. Roles must be used in the working communication instead of titles. Person's role depends on the context. Title doesn't.
