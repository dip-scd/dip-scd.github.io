      <h3 id="continuous-information-flow-instead-of-periodical-meetings">Continuous information flow instead of periodical meetings</h3>
<p>Any periodical meeting (such as sync-up, standup, demo, grooming) is a workaround that mitigates lack of proper communication channels in the organization. It can and should be replaced by a continuous flow of information, automatic documentation and ad-hoc (on demand) meetings with concrete agenda.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-as-a-primary-source-of-knowledge">Documentation as a primary source of knowledge</h3>
<p>Knowledge must be shared via documentation. Emails, IM, comments, meetings are for active discussions at the stage when decision or expertise regarding the specific topic is still emerging (i.e., for expert-to-expert communication). Once knowledge is acquired, it must be communicated to consumers via persistent documentation. Documentation can be further commented, discussed and changed, but the main point is that it can be easily referenced and shared.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-processes-automation">Continuous processes automation</h3>
<p>Processes automation is an essential activity that must have dedicated resources. Every trivial, repetitive activity, that is done by humans is a waste of organization resources. Such type of activity is especially ironical in software development companies.</p>

<h3 id="either-small-or-moderated-meetings">Either small or moderated meetings</h3>
<p>Non-moderated meeting with 5+ people is likely to be non-productive. With 10+ people it’s almost inevitable. These numbers are just empirical observations. There is no formal theory behind them.</p>

<h3 id="only-actually-working-processes">Only actually working processes</h3>
<p>If the process is unrealistic and clunky, it must be reviewed and changed asap, instead of ignoring the fact that everyone is working around this process. If the process in its current form is considered essential (for example, it’s related to security), then enforcing mechanisms should be introduced. One way or another, there must not be the case that process exists, but people are not working by it.</p>

<h3 id="removing-not-just-adding">Removing, not just adding</h3>
<p>Often much more can be achieved by removing a process, role, implementation, specification, then by adding a new one. Therefore there should be a continuous (rather than stop-the-world) process of refactoring of the technical systems and organization itself. People tend to avoid removing things because they don’t feel they have an authority to do so. Also, removing something requires a detailed analysis of the context while adding something seems more comfortable and safer.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-redundant-information">Avoiding redundant information</h3>
<p>Information must be referenced, not copy-pasted. In the case of documentation, this means that it should be created as hypertext, not text. In the case of communication, this means that proxy-mailing and similar practices must be avoided.</p>

<h3 id="reusing-external-knowledge">Reusing external knowledge</h3>
<p>Establishing internal mentorship and knowledge sharing is a good thing, but it’s important not to forget that there is a whole world out there. There is no need to re-invent internal best coding practices or project management essentials course. There is enough high-quality public information on that topic.</p>
